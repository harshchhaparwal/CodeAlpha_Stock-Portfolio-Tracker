# CodeAlpha_Stock-Portfolio-Tracker
The Stock Portfolio Tracker is a simple Python program that helps users calculate the total value of their stock investments. The program uses a hardcoded dictionary to store predefined stock prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250, "GOOGL": 140}).
The user provides input by entering the stock symbol (such as AAPL, TSLA, etc.) and the quantity of shares they own. For each valid entry, the program multiplies the stock’s price by the quantity to determine the investment value. All investments are stored in a dictionary-like structure, and the total portfolio value is updated accordingly.
The user may enter multiple stock purchases until they type "done". Once completed, the program displays:
A breakdown of each stock’s total value.
The overall portfolio value.
Additionally, the program offers an optional file-saving feature where results can be stored in a .txt file (or extended to .csv for tabular format).
This task uses fundamental Python concepts such as:
Dictionaries (for stock price storage)
Input/output (for user interaction)
Basic arithmetic (for calculating investment values)
File handling (for saving portfolio results)
Overall, this project provides a practical way to practice dictionary usage, user input handling, and arithmetic operations while simulating a real-world financial tracking scenario.
